# fec
1. Add a feature in individual branch
2. Push to individual github branch
2. Make pull request to testing branch
3. Get a code review from 1 person
4. Merge testing and notify others to pull down
   updated testing branch

  If you're working in a specific file that multiple people will access,
then mark it in trello board that you're working on it to avoid
merge conflict.

If there is a merge conflict, and it's a small issue like the example
Jake said, just fix it and move on. Otherwise, talk to the developer
you conflicted with. If you can't decide between the two of you, call
in rest of team.
